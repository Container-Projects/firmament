Firmament is a multi-scale execution engine for cluster computing under
development at the University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory.

It is currently in early alpha stage, with much of the high-level functionality
still missing, and interfaces frequently changing.


SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
-------------------

Firmament is currently known to work on Ubuntu 10.10 (maverick), 11.10 (oneric),
with caveats (see below) on 12.04 (precise); it does NOT work without extra
actions on 10.04 and 11.04.

Other configurations are untested - YMMV.

Reasons for known breakage:
* Ubuntu 10.04 - packaged clang/LLVM version too old (requires Clang >=2.9).
* Ubuntu 11.04 - broken dependency on /usr/include/linux/errno.h;
                 see http://pad.lv/774215 for a possible workaround
* Ubuntu 12.04 - when using Boost v1.48, the HTTP interface does not compile
                 due to libpion-net relying on a deprecated (and removed) Boost
                 feature. As a workaround, disable -D__HTTP_UI__ in
                 include/Makefile.config.unix


BUILDING & RUNNING
--------------------

$ make all

will fetch dependencies are necessary, and may ask you to install required
packages.

$ make test

will run unit tests.

Binaries are in the build/ subdirectory of the project root, and all accept the
--helpshort argument to show their command line options.
