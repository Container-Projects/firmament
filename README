Firmament is -- or rather, hopefully will be -- a multi-scale execution engine
for cluster computing.


SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
-------------------

Firmament is currently known to work on Ubuntu 10.10 (maverick) and
11.10 (oneric); it does NOT work without extra actions on 10.04 and 11.04.

Other configurations are untested - YMMV.

Reasons for known breakage:
* Ubuntu 10.04 - packaged clang/LLVM version too old.
* Ubuntu 11.04 - broken dependency on /usr/include/linux/errno.h;
                 see http://pad.lv/774215 for a possible workaround


BUILDING & RUNNING
--------------------

$ make all

will fetch dependencies are necessary, and may ask you to install required
packages.

$ make test

will run unit tests.

Binaries are in the build/ subdirectory of the project root.
