Wonderous things are bound to appear here in the future.


SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
-------------------

Wonderous things are currently known to work on Ubuntu 10.10 (maverick) and
11.10 (oneric); they are known to NOT work on 10.04 and 11.04.

Other configurations are untested - YMMV.

Reasons for known breakage:
* Ubuntu 10.04 - clang/LLVM version too old.
* Ubuntu 11.04 - broken dependency on /usr/include/linux/errno.h;
                 see http://pad.lv/774215 for a possible workaround
